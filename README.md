"Speedy Health" is a Serious Game, developed through Unity Software, that consist in a driver simulator to improve the skills of  new ambulance drivers.[SpeedyHealth.pdf](https://github.com/Sawyer-108/Speedy--Health-/files/8950062/SpeedyHealth.pdf)

For the past two years, the world has been under attack from an invisible enemy, the Coronavirus, which 
has brought the entire globe to its knees by attacking every aspect: from economics to health, from 
education to sociality.
Among the many wounds caused by this pandemic, one of the biggest was inflicted on the world of 
healthcare, which was brought to the brink of collapse, put under pressure by an unexpected enemy 
against which we continue to fight today.1
To help the healthcare system, every time, every moment and every frame wasted have been reduced to 
their minimum and a great hand has been required from inexperienced doctors, stretcher bearers, nurses 
and ambulance workers, catapulted into a global pandemic emergency.2 To get these new resources ready, 
in addition to direct experience in the field, an alternative way is represented by serious games, capable of 
presenting situations similar to the real ones on which to practice. Following this way of thinking, "SPEEDYHEALTH" was born, a third-person driving simulator of an ambulance that presents a focus on variables that 
can put an ambulance driver in difficulty during emergency situations.
This simulator features a basic driving system to push the player to focus on unexpected events, difficulties, 
timing and choices that the driver must make in a context of emergency and neuroticism.
In "SPEEDY-HEALTH" you will therefore have to drive an ambulance inside a city that has different roads to 
reach the objectives. Such targets are patients with COVID-19, with symbolic lives that decrease over time 
and that will force the driver to find the right "road-patient" combination to get them both to safety before 
their lives go to zero. The ambulance transport protocols in case of emergency, and especially during this 
pandemic situation provide that only one patient at a time can be transported on board during the journey, 
to date not even a family member can get on board if you it deals with covid but only specialized 
personnel.3
This will imply a ban, with consequent loss of the consignment in the event of an attempt by the user, to 
load both patients on board, therefore they will have to be recovered one patient at a time and 
transported to the hospital before caring for the next patient.
During the journey, to complicate the surrounding environment there will be cars, unexpected events and 
passers-by that will increase the degree of complexity and realism of a possible recovery situation, causing 
the end of the game if an accident occurs.
